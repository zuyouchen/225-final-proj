# CS 225 Final Project: Elden Ring Speedrun Optimizer
Final Project for CS 225 in Spring 2023, created by Malcolm Kaplan, Evan Chen, Tyler Cushing, Numair Hajyani, and Gyury Lee. 

## GitHub File Organization



## Installation

1) Set-up the CS 225 Docker environment. Instructions can be found [here](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2023/resources/own-machine/). Place the Docker file in the root directory of the project (make sure your Docker environment is running before opening this folder).

2) Clone the respository into a folder within the CS 225 Docker environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zuyouchen/225-final-proj.git
```

3) All files are present upon cloning. We are using MAKE rather than CMAKE, so you need not create a build folder or anything like that.

## Running the Program

1) Open a bash terminal

2) To run the program normally, type

```bash
make exec
```

and then 

```bash
./bin/exec
```

3) To run our test suite, type
