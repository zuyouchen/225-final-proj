# Full Written Report
 
A written report. In addition to your code, your Github repository must contain a results.md file which describes:

    The output and correctness of each algorithm – You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

    The answer to your leading question – You should direct address your proposed leading question. How did you answer this question? What did you discover? If your project was ultimately unsuccessful, give a brief reflection about what worked and what you would do differently as a team.

## Leading Question

Our leading question was what is the fastest Elden Ring speedun (either an All Major Bosses route or an any% route) as constructed using a graph data structure and various graph traversal and path-finding algorithms? To answer this question, we inputted all major locations in Elden Ring as nodes, each storing a time to complete (0 if just a location to pass through, or a positive double if a boss fight) with edges between nodes representing the time it would take to go from one node to another. Using this structure, we were able to run path finding algorithms such as Dijkstra's and Floyd-Washall to find optimal routes throughout the game.
