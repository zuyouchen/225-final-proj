# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**  
We will be meeting weekly on Sundays at 2 PM at the Siebel Center for Computer Science. These meetings will last anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on availability that week. We also plan to work on the project throughout the week to work towards implementation goals. We will be communicating via a private Discord server with multiple communication channels. 
2. **Assistance**  
We will ask on our private Discord if any of us need help. Team members will ideally respond within a business day. Exceptions can be made given exams, projects, and other obligations. Everyone on the team is expected to jump in to help other team members when needed. 
3. **Respect**  
Ideas brought up by any member of the group will be considered thoroughly. Discussions are expected to be respectful and understanding of all ideas brought up by any team member. We will seek every team member’s input to ensure all members are actively listening. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**  
Rather than assigning particular deliverables to specific members of our team, we will collectively work towards completion of our project incrementally. In the case of unforeseen or unexpected complications, we should all be expected to step up and work to completion. In the event of an emergency, we can divide work more granularly during our weekly team meetings. 
5. **Time Commitment**  
We expect a commitment of 2-3 hours from each group member per week. We all have various time commitments throughout the week ranging from schoolwork to professional work, but Sundays at 2PM should be free most weeks for our group. In the case of unexpected conflicts, we will communicate via Discord to reschedule a meeting or meet virtually if necessary. 
6. **Conflict Resolution**  
If we ever have a disagreement, then we’ll attempt to resolve it internally by leaving the decision up to a majority vote, and if this can’t be resolved in this manner we would then like to contact a staff member and take their concerns into consideration.

For example, if a member doesn’t act in a way that is conducive to a positive, productive environment and we can’t resolve this conflict internally, then we will as mentioned above contact a staff member.
